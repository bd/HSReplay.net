## Installation

Install development dependencies with `pip install -r requirements/dev.txt`.

Settings are present in the `hsreplaynet/settings.py` file. You may copy the
`local_settings.example.py` file to `hsreplaynet/local_settings.py` to
customize settings without modifying the versioned file. This is especially
useful to store sensitive settings such as API keys.
Several settings such as Sentry, Influx and S3 are disabled by default. The
default database engine is set to sqlite3.

Run the dev server with `./manage.py runserver [host:port]`. Will run on
`localhost:8000` by default.

The API is available at `/api/v1/` and is browsable using the DRF interface.
